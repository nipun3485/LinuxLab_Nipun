# Experiment 04 – Shell Scripting Basics

## Objective
To learn the basics of shell scripting, including script creation, variables, user input, and executing shell scripts.

## Commands Used
- `nano` – Create and edit script files.
- `chmod +x` – Make shell scripts executable.
- `./script.sh` – Run the shell script.
- `echo` – Print text on the screen.
- `read` – Accept user input.

## Procedure
1. Created a shell script named `script1.sh` that displays a welcome message.
2. Created a second script `script2.sh` that uses variables.
3. Developed a third script `script3.sh` that accepts user input using `read`.
4. Made all scripts executable using `chmod +x`.
5. Executed all scripts and observed their output.
6. Took a screenshot of the output and saved it as `output4.png`.

## Conclusion
This experiment demonstrated how to create, edit, and execute basic shell scripts. Understanding variables, user input, and permissions is essential for automating tasks in Linux.
