##  Experiments Covered

### ** Experiment 01 – File and Directory Commands**
This experiment introduces basic Linux commands for handling files and directories.  
Topics include:
- Navigating directories
- Creating, moving, and deleting files
- Copying files and directories
- Viewing contents using `cat`, `ls`, `pwd`, etc.

---

### ** Experiment 02 – File Permissions**
Focuses on understanding permissions such as read, write, and execute.  
Tasks include:
- Creating files and checking default permissions
- Modifying permissions using `chmod`
- Granting or removing access for user, group, and others

---

### ** Experiment 03 – Filters and Text Processing**
This experiment covers Linux text-processing utilities used for filtering and analyzing text.  
Commands include:
- `cat`, `head`, `tail`
- `sort`, `uniq`
- `tr`, `cut`, `paste`
- `grep` for pattern matching

---

### ** Experiment 04 – Shell Scripting Basics**
Introduces basic shell scripting concepts.  
Topics include:
- Creating and executing shell scripts
- Using variables
- Accepting user input
- Using `echo`, basic loops, and simple logic

---

### **Experiment 05 – Shell Script Programs (Prime, Armstrong, Sum of Digits)**
A set of mathematical programming tasks implemented using shell scripts:
- Checking if a number is prime
- Calculating sum of digits
- Armstrong number detection
Each task demonstrates loops, arithmetic, and conditional checks.

---

### ** Experiment 06 – Palindrome, GCD/LCM, Sorting**
Contains three shell scripting tasks:
1. Checking if a number is palindrome  
2. Calculating GCD and LCM of two numbers  
3. Sorting numbers in ascending and descending order  
This experiment enhances understanding of loops, arrays, and arithmetic logic.

---

### ** Experiment 07 – File Handling, Process & Scheduling Scripts**
Combined tasks involving shell scripting concepts such as:
- Checking if a file exists and optionally creating it  
- Printing numbers using loops  
- Counting lines, words, and characters using `wc`  
- Calculating factorial using a custom function  
This improves command-line automation and logical scripting skills.

---

### ** Experiment 08 – File Permissions, String Operations, Pattern Search, System Info**
Advanced shell scripting tasks:
- Checking file permissions using test operators  
- Performing string operations (length, concatenation, comparison)  
- Searching for patterns using `grep`  
- Displaying system information (`date`, `who`, `uptime`, `free`, `df`)
